# Crossing the Aisles
_A website dedicated to open-source legislative information about the 119th Congress._

## Purpose of the site

Read the `/about` page for a more detailed description. In a nutshell, this site is
designed to visualize voting information from all members of the 119th Congress,
highlighting how often lawmakers are voting with their own party vs. "crossing the
aisle" to vote for legislation or nominees put forward by the opposition party.

If you see any errors in the data or in the interpretation of the data, it's possible
those are upstream data errors, but please file an issue anyway so we can look into it.

**Please note that this site is not yet live. Hopefully we will go live by May 1.**
